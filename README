 fillin:
 dragdrop:
 numeric: (with tolerance (+- 0.2 etc) 
   or with norm:mean,stddev, your score is 1 on the mean, fall of to 0.4 one stddev away, 0 2 stddev away
 sequence:
   place items in category (ordered or unordered)
   the scoring handles on off ( bcdefa is nearly abcdef, you have the order correct for all but one)
   and reversed seq (fedcba is in same order as abcdef, but reversed )

   postgres
   read setup_postgres.txt
   get node.js v 4.9 (git branch; git checkout .. )
    make and install
    you will also need npm matching this version
   all required modules from npm (see server.js and database.js)
   'grep require *' will give all required modules (those without './')
   install POUND if you wish to run several sites from same server
     see pound.cfg.example
   OR  iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 3000
     so that users can connect to port 80
   OR  run as root and set port to 80
   OR  if gateways allow, use port 3000 .. in adress
     http://some.site.com:3000/sitename
